Ran into this error: 

Reproject DEM to EPSG:3857  --->
ERROR 6: Unable to load PROJ.4 library (libproj.so), creation of
OGRCoordinateTransformation failed.

Hoping to add this to the path..?

The problem is a bug that appears frequently in older versions of GDAL.

According to the bug report (https://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/ticket/2)
the easy way to fix it is with this command:

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libproj.so.0 /usr/lib/libproj.so

This creates a symlink to the proper libproj.so file. I've added this 
line to /etc/rc.local so this link is set every time the server boots as
suggested in this forum thread:
