<h3 id="Biography"><a href="#Biography" class="headerlink" title="Biography"></a>Biography</h3><p>Born in Michigan but raised a Hoosier, Dr. Shortridge enjoyed geography from an early age. He took computer cartography in his 4th (but not final!) year of undergraduate studies at Indiana University and realized that GIS would be his professional passion. He spent the last half of the 1990’s on a beach in Santa Barbara obtaining his Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geography, but was happy to move back to the Midwest to join the MSU Geography Department in January, 2001. Since then his professional life has been devoted to developing multiple GIScience degree programs at MSU, teaching cutting-edge GIS and spatial analysis courses, and conducting and communicating research on a range of thematic and methodologically-oriented projects. Dr. Shortridge is married, with three wonderful girls, so family time is a priority. True to his Indiana roots, he also maintains a fine basketball goal out back.</p>
<h3 id="Research-Interests"><a href="#Research-Interests" class="headerlink" title="Research Interests"></a>Research Interests</h3><p>My general interests are in the realm of geographic information science, spatial analysis, and health geography. I focus on five particular areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>digital representation of terrain</li>
<li>spatial data uncertainty models</li>
<li>error propagation and GIS</li>
<li>digital geomorphology</li>

<h3 id="Research-Interests-1"><a href="#Research-Interests-1" class="headerlink" title="Research Interests"></a>Research Interests</h3><p>My research program focuses broadly upon Medical Geography, Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) and the techniques and theoretical methods that allow one to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of change, including, Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing, Complexity Theory, and Dynamic Spatial Simulation Models. Within the LULCC context, I have directed research projects in Ecuador, Kenya, Thailand, Michigan, and the Florida Bay. I am currently working on sleeping sickness (NIH) and malaria (NSF) projects in Kenya, LULCC (NASA) in Urumqi and Shanghai, health care access (MDCH) in Michigan, and drug war remote sensing in Ecuador and Colombia.</p>

<h3 id="Research-Synopsis"><a href="#Research-Synopsis" class="headerlink" title="Research Synopsis"></a>Research Synopsis</h3><p>With improving understanding of human-environment systems as well as advancing computing technology, modeling of complex system dynamics, such as Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC), is becoming increasingly better defined and sophisticated. However, a fundamental problem within these modeling processes, the relatively low quality of input data, such as land cover map, seldom receives enough attention. Even if the model accurately represents the mechanism of the system, errors and uncertainties within the input data will propagate and probably produce drastic effects on the simulation results. Due to the limitation of current technology, the quality of certain data set is difficult to improve at present. An alternative approach is to incorporate our understanding of errors and uncertainty into the process of complex system modeling, in order to acquire more knowledge on their effect and thus develop appropriate confidence intervals of the modeling result.</p>
<p>This research will looking at potential LUCC in Urumqi area, China, for the near-term (2021-2030). The main objectives of this research are: 1) measuring the propagation pattern of uncertainty from input data to the result, identifying confidence intervals as well as confidence regions accordingly within the study area; 2) discuss some most likely future scenarios of LUCC for Urumqi based on the acquired knowledge of uncertainty. A well defined and widely used LUCC model, dyna-CLUE, will be employed as the core approach of future LUCC simulation. An uncertainty model based on geostatistical technology will be embedded, and Monte Carlo simulation will be applied to test the effect of input data uncertainty on the result of future LUCC scenarios. The outcome of this study will improve the reliability of knowledge we draw from traditional LUCC models. Some socio-environmental adaptation recommendations will then be proposed accordingly to assist policy-making.</p>

<h3 id="Biography-2"><a href="#Biography-2" class="headerlink" title="Biography"></a>Biography</h3><p>Nick is a masters student who has an almost unhealthy obsession with GIS. During his time getting his B.A. in Geography from the University of St. Thomas in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, he became interested in bringing the power of geography to the masses. In the name of that goal he worked with Saint Paul - Ramsey County Public Health in the Environmental Health Department to perform and Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment aiding the county government in their preparations future. He also volunteered with the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="external">North Star Sierra Club</a> to create the <a href="https://nronnei.github.io/ttgs/" target="_blank" rel="external">Transit to Green Space</a> web map, helping Twin Cities residents sate their thirst for nature without the need for a private vehicle. He firmly believes that geography benefits everyone, and these projects are his way of democratizing it. His work continues at Michigan State University where he is developing a full stack system to distribute the results of complex geostatistical models to researchers around the globe empowering them to get better, more meaningful results from their work.</p>
<h3 id="Research-Interests-2"><a href="#Research-Interests-2" class="headerlink" title="Research Interests"></a>Research Interests</h3><p>Generally speaking, Nick’s interested in anything that involves GIS. However, he’s particularly interested in:</p>

<li>Transportation Geography</li>
<li>Geostats</li>
<li>GIS Development</li>
<li>GIS Data Models</li>
<li>Uncertainty in Spatial Data</li>

<h3 id="Biography-3"><a href="#Biography-3" class="headerlink" title="Biography"></a>Biography</h3><p>Shengpan is a doctoral student working on climate change and water quality. He was made in a small town of China, but he has a big dream to be a hero to save our planet from catastrophic climate change. He has a B.Sc. and M. Sc. in aquaculture. With that knowledge, he hopes he could contribute to a world without hunger and poverty by building profitable fish farms, and providing delicious fish and high quality protein for families. He received his fist Ph.D. in Remote Sensing and Geo-information from Zhejiang University, China. The global satellite views changed his vision of our world; he realized he could do more and have an impact beyond our generation. To gather ammunition and army, he joined ESPP in January 2013. (Declaration: “ammunition” and “army” here are metaphors. Shengpan has no intent to collect any real ammunition or build any army in United States. Please do NOT call Homeland Security.)</p>
